# @aaronshunter Teleprompter Setup

Hey hey! Welcome to the guide :) 

If you’re here, you probably heard me talking about my teleprompter and how I use it to join meetings, teach AWS Training and Certification (T&C) courses, or [deliver a show on Twitch](https://awspowerhour.com/). Using a teleprompter is a great way to maintain eye contact with the camera without losing focus on your subject or content. Huge thanks to my friend Jon Dion because, without him, I’d still be awkwardly staring off to the side of the camera. But first, a disclaimer!

Let’s break this article down into a few categories:

* Gear/Equipment
* Trainings
* Meetings

## Gear/Equipment

First, the gear. There are a few pieces of equipment I’ve found that helped me get set up for my personal preference. Your mileage may vary, so find what works best for you. My setup includes the **Glide Gear TMP100 teleprompter** ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019AJOLEM/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_glt_fabc_KYZ051F01PBNC818DNTS?pldnSite=1)). This is a really nice teleprompter for what I need it to do. It has a fully adjustable bracket that slides in and out, the glass tilts to different viewing angles, and there’s a fabric hood in the back to help prevent light from shining through the glass. Nice, so nice. Note: The TMP100 images show a DSLR (really big camera) is attached, but I personally use my **Logitech C920** (oldie but a goodie) without any issues. 

**TELEPROMPTER/MONITOR**
The teleprompter is marketed for an iPad/Tablet/Smartphone, but you can use it with a monitor as well. Using an iPad as a monitor doesn’t work me so I looked around for a monitor that I could use. I ordered 7, yes SEVEN, different monitors until I found one that fits the TMP100 bracket spacing. I settled with the **WIMAXIT 10.1 inch Monitor** ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074JWQ57Y/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_glt_fabc_915M9SZWG2EZTKQQQB4S?pldnSite=1))**. **While this monitor has a 1920x1080 resolution, which is more than enough for my needs, there is one major drawback that doesn’t work as a functional teleprompter display... YOU CAN’T ROTATE THE DISPLAY! So, I use OBS to flip my display. Maybe one day I’ll find a monitor that fits and has that functionality, but for now this works good enough :)

**DESK MOUNT**
Ok, so now that we have our teleprompter and monitor - we need a way to attach it to our desk. I mean... it doesn’t just float (but how awesome would that be?!). For this, I use the **VIVO Single Monitor Arm** ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B21TLQU/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_glt_fabc_FDFK7S75MF2DCM7RHVJW?_encoding=UTF8&pldnSite=1&th=1)) which I found the teleprompter fits perfectly onto one of the bolts on the arm. I can loosen a single bolt to adjust the arm up and down, then tighten the bolt again. once it’s in the correct height, I can swivel the arm to the exact position I need. It’s inexpensive, simple to install and adjust, and works just fine!

**LIGHTING**
**NEW (May 2022)!** I’ve added a ring light to my collection of gear. I ordered and tested a few ring lights and found the **Lume Cube 18 Inch Cordless Ring Light** ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08WWGRN2Y/?th=1)) is the better option in my opinion. The 18 inch model fits perfectly over the teleprompter and casts a beautiful light. Something I’ve found The benefit of using a ring light is an even and flattering light on the face, and helps to reduce light that’s reflected from eyeglasses (in my experience). 

**UPDATED (Oct 2022)!** I’ve replaced the ring light with an **Elgato Key Light** ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Key-Light-Professional-App-Enabled/dp/B07L755X9G?th=1)). There isn’t anything wrong with the ring light but, because I wear glasses, the ring light caused a reflection on my lenses. The Elgato Key Light can be positioned offset from the camera, which helps significantly. 

Here are some photos of each component:

## Trainings

Cool. I just ~~spent~~ invested a lot of money (insert burning money emoji here)... cool cool cool. Now what? Use it for the fun stuff! 

I use the teleprompter for my digital content and presentations. I’ve also used it to stream Let’s Ship it with AWS and AWS Power Hour series on Twitch! Check out awspowerhour.com to see those episodes. Due to the monitor limitations, I have use OBS Studio to flip the display and have the teleprompter mounted directly above my laptop, so I use either the laptop display or my drawing tablet. There are so many ways you could do this, so do what’s best for you --- this is just what works best for me... for now :) 

**OBS Studio Preview window**
Create a new scene
Give the scene a name
Connect a source (LaptopDisplayCapture in my case for example)
Edit the display through OBS to flip/mirror horizontally (right click on the display, transform, flip horizontal)

**OBS Program window**
Right click 
Full screen to projector
Select your teleprompter monitor

Now I use my laptop as the primary monitor that is mirrored and displayed on the teleprompter monitor!

Here’s a picture of the monitor with an introduction training module (Advanced Architecting on AWS in the house... w00t w00t):

## Meetings

I do the same thing for meetings too! I use this for my Chime meetings which helps so so so much. Now I can focus on people in the meeting who have their webcam enabled without looking off to the side and it allows me to maintain eye contact with the camera. 

Here’s a picture of a Chime meeting. I’ve added a second photo that’s zoomed in where you can (barely) see two blue “parenthesis” looking things... that’s my **Logitech C920** camera! *I know... I know... I’m not looking at the camera. Shame!* PROOF you don’t need a big DSLR camera. In fact, I prefer having the blue lines so I know I’m looking at the camera since the camera isn’t easily seen through the mirror. **

## Conclusion

In the end, the teleprompter is one of the best enhancements to my desk setup and I wish I added it years ago. Virtual engagements will **never** be the same. Totally worth the money, time, and energy. 

Alright everyone. I hope you found this helpful and remember:
Happy cloud computing from all of us here at AWS!
